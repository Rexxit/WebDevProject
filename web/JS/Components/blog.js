            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p> 
            Designing the website wasn't that bad it was a pretty nice experience. Utilizing the color picker
            and paint.net made things a bit easier. I do want to change the image of the site and how the text 
            will be. I added the media query into the #titleNav, but I still couldn't get it to work and I've been
            at it for days. I'll get it to work for the final project, but now it's not even willing to. 
            But overall it's not that bad for my first time doing web development. I do want to get better
            and make the site better for the ending project but right now I like what I have done.
            </p>    
            
            <h3>Database</h3>
            <p>
            The database table I want for the site would have a variety of games and streamers in it.
            I want the database to hold the game's pricing so people would know the pricing on them. A small
            description of what the game is about. The genre of the game along with which console it is on. I
            also want the ratings of the game if they're out already and a link to the game if they want to view more
            on it. For the streamer's, I want to have information on which platform they are on. I also want to have 
            whether they are live or not and have a link to the corresponding site they are live on.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Homepage Homework</h3>
            <p> 
            Working with the background image and implementing the external style sheets were pretty easy to do.
            Some parts that I found hard/confusing was the titleNav and the flexbox. What I found the most challenging about the 
            titleNav was that even though I used the code that was provided, I couldn't seem to either 
            get the title and the contents of the nav bar to not clash or the spacing was different so I couldn't tell if I did it correctly. 
            I was confused on whether a flex attribute is also a flexbox or not. What I found valuable about this homework was just learning 
            everything. Although, since it's my first time I don't have everything down, but as I continue to do this, I'm hoping it would 
            make more sense.

            <h3>JavaScript UI Homework</h3>
            <p> 
                The UI homework was seemingly hard to do at first. I couldn't utilize the javascript but when I started to understand what I was doing it all started to come together.
                Implementing the JS portion was fine once I realized I didn't need to include <script></script> into the javascript file. Once things started coming together and I started
                to implement the drop down menus everything was working properly. The only thing I couldn't do for this HW was the routing.
            </p>
    
            <h3>SlideShow Homework</h3>
            <p> 
                The slideshow homework wasn't that bad because the lab activity was very useful on this. With this homework I got the routing down that I didn't finish doing in the previous
                homework. After the routing was completed implementing the slideshow tab wasn't too hard to do. Having the javascript file take in objects and utlizing the ajax file, things
                started to become easier and easier. The only problem I have currently is implementing the optionalPreference, which I'm still confused about, but I'm continuing to work on my site.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Database Homework</h3>
            <p>
                My experience with databases is pretty small. I have taken database management back in Community College of Philadelphia(CCP), but our teacher didn't use mySQL workbench. We
                mainly wrote the commands down in a word document with a table image provided. It wasn't that bad because it did give me a foundation of what database management was like and 
                being able to utilize the commands in a GUI that make everything so much easier. This homework refreshed my knowledge of databases and gave me insight on new ideas I could do. 
                Once I figure out how to connect it to netbeans or eclipse will be a game changer on how I set up databases and program with it.
        
                Here's a link to my homework PDF:<a target="_blank" href='pics/Cook_database.pdf'>Database Document</a>
                There wasn't really any hard parts about this homework assignment since I had some knowledge about databases prior to this assignment. The easy parts was making the tables and
                inserting the data into the cells of the tables. The GUI of mySQL workbench made things pretty easy and simple to work with. Which in that self is amazing design. The valuable
                parts that I liked about this assigment was retouching up on the sleeping knowledge I had for databases. Being able to utilize the query and having commands saved to make things
                easier to access when needed is valuable.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Data Display Homework</h3>
            <p>
                Doing this homework wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Since doing the lab assignment made things pretty easier. I had some problems when implementing the search function
                so it was annoying trying to implement that on the table. But after trial and error I've somehow succeeded in the implementation. The only problem I have with this assignment 
                is when I implemented my table and the sort function isn't working properly for the name and the game cost.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Web API Homework</h3>
            <p>
                This weeks's homework was pretty important to do. With this homework we make and utilize APIs to establish a connection with our database that we made in the previous homework.
                It was kinda easy if you did lab five so we can get an understanding on how to utilize java files and packages. The only problem I've encountered that I need to work on more is
                that the images are not showing up when the API is being called. The only thing that shows is the URL to the images. I still need to figure out how to fix this problem. The URL
                to the Web API Error document is: <a target="_blank" href='pics/WebAPIErrors.pdf'>Web API Error Document</a>. The link to the webAPIs are: <a href="webAPIs/listUsersAPI.jsp">
                ListUserAPI</a> and <a href="webAPIs/listGameAPI.jsp">ListGameAPI</a>.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Logon Homework</h3>
            <p>
                Logon homework in itself was pretty hard for me at first. When I was doing the lab activities it was okay since Lab activity 6a was pretty straight forward, but when I did lab
                activity b it got more complicated since I couldn't get the database to produce the proper information. So when I was doing the homework and copying what I was doing with the
                lab activities I was still getting the same problems I was with the lab activities. I actually managed to figure my problem out and that was changing the '<' of the SQL statement
                to '=' and that fixed the problem I was having. The other hard part was building the account.js file. This wasn't all that bad but it was a challeneged thing to do. Overall, the 
                homework was challenging in my perspective which made me think more and go about it in a more serious mannaer than I usually do. 
                The link to Logon is <a href="webAPIs/logonAPI.jsp?userEmail=batman@gotham.org&userPass=batM">Logon</a>. The link to Get Profile is <a href="webAPIs/getProfile.jsp">Get Profile</a>.
                The link to Logoff is <a href="webAPIs/logoffAPI.jsp">Logoff</a>. Finally listing all web users is <a href="webAPIs/listUsersAPI.jsp">List Users</a>
            </p>
    
            <h3>Insert Homework</h3>
            <p>
                This insert homework wasn't bad in itself. The hardest part of the homework was implementing my webGameMods.js and getitng that to work. I was rewriting a lot of things in the file
                which made me mispell a lot of things when typing it out which lead to the actual file not working. The easiet part of the homework was implementing the webUserList and webUserMods
                files which I already did from the Lab Activity. The important thing about this assignment was implementing the insert aspect of the site. This allows users to implement their own
                data into the database. The link to the database document is: <a target="_blank" href='pics/Cook_database.pdf'>Database Document</a>.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Update Homework</h3>
            <p>
                This update homework was a bit hard and I'm definetly sure I need to fix it up because it's saying the update isn't in the route array when I definetly coded it in. So I'm going to
                have to fix this problem by the next homework. Other than that the easy and good parts about it was inserting the updating portion onto the column of the list. I need to do a better
                job at organizing my files and have a better naming scheme for this project so I can do a better job at producing the homework.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Delete Homework</h3>
            <p>
                The delete homework wasn't that bad compared to the update homework. THere's sitll a piece I need to finish for the final project but overall it's pretty good.
                The hardest part of the assingment was my naming schemes and incorporating all the appropriate files over and making sure I have everything neatly organized and
                in the correct spots. The easiet part of the homework was making the delete api's since it was mostly covered already.
